Relational Algebra at your fingertips

Alf brings the relational algebra both in Shell and in Ruby. In Shell, because 
manipulating any relation-like data source should be as straightforward as a 
one-liner. In Ruby, because I've never understood why programming languages 
provide data structures like arrays, hashes, sets, trees and graphs but not 
_relations_... Let's stop the segregation ;-)

Alf follows semantic versioning (http://semver.org/) and has not reached its 
first stable 1.0.0 release. Quoting semver.org: "Anything may change at any 
time. The public API should not be considered stable". Including alf with the 
version requirement "~> 0.10.1" shouldn't break your code.

Changes:

# 0.10.1 / 2011-08-31

## Miscellaneous enhancements

* Added Variance and Stddev aggregation operators; they are available under 
  Aggregator.variance{} and Aggregator.stddev{}, respectively
* Added a --pretty option to 'alf', whose semantics is delegated to the output 
  renderer. Same option is available on 'alf show'.
* 'alf show' now accepts an optional ordering argument. This avoids explicitely
  including non-relational sort invocations in your pipe (sorting should be 
  seen as a displaying issue)
* Added an options hash to text renderer, :float_format among others
* Added a --ff option to 'alf show', for float format in text rendering

## Bugfixes

* Alf::Environment::(Folder/Explicit)#dataset now correctly raises a 
  NoSuchDatasetError when the dataset cannot be found, as required by the
  specification.
* Alf::Reader.reader now correctly returns a Rash reader when invoked on a 
  StringIO
