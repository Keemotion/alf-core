RELATIONAL OPERATORS

    project          Relational projection (clip + compact)
    extend           Relational extension (additional, computed attributes)
    rename           Relational renaming (rename some attributes)
    restrict         Relational restriction (aka where, predicate filtering)
    join             Relational join (and cross-join)
    intersect        Relational intersection (aka a logical and)
    minus            Relational minus (aka difference)
    union            Relational union
    matching         Relational matching (join + project back on left)
    not-matching     Relational not matching (inverse of matching)
    wrap             Relational wraping (tuple-valued attributes)
    unwrap           Relational un-wraping (inverse of wrap)
    group            Relational grouping (relation-valued attributes)
    ungroup          Relational un-grouping (inverse of group)
    summarize        Relational summarization (group-by + aggregate ops)
    rank             Relational ranking (explicit tuple positions)

EXPERIMENTAL RELATIONAL OPERATORS

    quota     Generalized quota-queries (position, sum progression, etc.)

NON-RELATIONAL OPERATORS

    autonum      Extend its operand with an unique autonumber attribute
    defaults     Force default values on missing/nil attributes
    compact      Remove tuple duplicates
    sort         Sort input tuples according to an order relation
    clip         Clip input tuples to a subset of attributes
    coerce       Force attribute coercion according to a heading

OTHER NON-RELATIONAL COMMANDS

    exec     Executes an .alf file on current environment
    help     Show help about a specific command
    show     Output input tuples through a specific renderer (text, yaml, ...)

See 'alf help COMMAND' for details about a specific command.
