Sort input tuples according to an order relation

SYNOPSIS

  #{shell_signature}

DESCRIPTION

This non-relational operator sorts input tuples according to ORDERING. 

This is, of course, a non relational operator as relations are unordered 
sets. It is provided for displaying purposes and normalization of 
non-relational inputs.

EXAMPLE

  alf sort suppliers -- name asc
  alf sort suppliers -- city desc name asc
