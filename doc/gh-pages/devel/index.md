## Alf &mdash; The development side

* Alf is an open-source project implemented in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)
* It is distributed under a [MIT licence](devel/licence.html)
* The source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/blambeau/alf)
* The issue tracker is hosted [on Github as well](https://github.com/blambeau/alf/issues)

### Contribute

The overal mechanism to contribute is by forking the project on [Github](https://github.com/blambeau/alf). There are lots of stuff you can contribute to:

#### The library itself

  * You'll have to master Ruby, but it's a good opportunity to learn this wonderful language. 
  * Everything is welcome except non-relational proposals (which can still be made, but will be kindly rejected for sure):
  * Fixing bugs; Implementing new options; New features; New rubyisms; Contributing to experimental operators; and so on.  

#### The documentation

  * Alf documentation is maintained in [text files](https://github.com/blambeau/alf/tree/master/doc/gh-pages/devel/index.md) (using the [markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/blambeau/alf/tree/master/doc).
  * Commands and operator descriptions may be found in [doc/commands](https://github.com/blambeau/alf/tree/master/doc/commands) and [doc/operators](https://github.com/blambeau/alf/tree/master/doc/operators), respectively.
  * The pages of this web site can be found in [doc/gh-pages](https://github.com/blambeau/alf/tree/master/doc/gh-pages) and its subfolders.

#### Ideas, issues and critical reading

  * New ideas are welcome, for almost everything. Implemented ideas are prefered, but not required. 
  * Critical reading from TTM-aware people is necessary and welcome. Create an issue in [our bug tracker]((https://github.com/blambeau/alf/issues) if your review/question/proposal is limited to Alf (misunderstanding of a TUTORIAL D operator by Alf, for example). Start a new thread on the TTM mailing list if it is more general (like discussing an experimental operator implemented in Alf).
