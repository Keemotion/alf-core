## Contributors

I'm very grateful to Erwin Smout for his helpful review of- and numerous comments about Alf documentation. Thanks go to Fabre Lambeau as well for his review of the "Why Alf" page.

I also take this opportunity to thank [Dan Kubb](https://github.com/dkubb) and [Magnus Holm](https://github.com/judofyr) for the interresting discussions about relational algebra in general, and [Alf](https://github.com/blambeau/alf) and [Veritas](https://github.com/dkubb/veritas). I hope we'll find opportunities to contribute even more in the future!

Alf has been created and is currently maintained by [Bernard Lambeau](https://github.com/blambeau).
