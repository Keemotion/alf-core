* Refactor meta-programming in TupleHandle
* Check that nothing exists that proves better than Hash[*...]
* Refactor NEST to allow a Hash of :newname => [:nested, :attributes]
* Refactor GROUP to allow a Hash of :newname => [:nested, :attributes]
* Add PIVOT and UNPIVOT operators
* Shouldn't PROJECT remove duplicates after all??
* Avoid building a new TupleHandle instance on each tuple in Extend
