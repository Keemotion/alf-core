## Why Alf?

The end of the relational era has been predicted many times since the middle of 90'. As of today, it has not been replaced by XML, nor by Object-Oriented databases, and I strongly predict that it won't be superseded by NoSQL technologies. 

I'm personally convinced that the so-called 'relational model' won't disappear. There are very good reasons for this, that have been explained in depth elsewhere. At the heart of those reasons, the relational 'kernel' **is** a theory: a **sound**, **mathematical**, **powerful**, and **simple** theory. 

Unfortunately, the relational theory is as unknown (or at least ill-known) as it is powerful.
