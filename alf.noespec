    Relational Algebra at your fingertips
  description: |-
    Alf brings the relational algebra both in Shell and in Ruby. In Shell, because 
    manipulating any relation-like data source should be as straightforward as a 
    one-liner. In Ruby, because I've never understood why programming languages 
    provide data structures like arrays, hashes, sets, trees and graphs but not 
    _relations_... Let's stop the segregation ;-)
