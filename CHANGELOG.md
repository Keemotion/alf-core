# 0.14.0 / FIX ME

## Types

* Introduced Selector as an ordered list of attribute names. An Ordering is now
  a list of [Selector, (:asc|:desc)] pairs.
* Introduced Selection as an ordered list of Selectors.
* Accordingly, orderings may now include selections on tuple-valued attributes.
* Added Ordering#[] that returns the direction associated to an attribute.
* Added Ordering#reverse that reverse the direction of every attribute.
* Fixed Ordering#+ to avoid duplicate attributes. This operator is now called
  `merge` (with alias to `+`) and looks like Hash#merge, including an block to
  arbitrate conflicts.

## Relation

* Added Relation#to_hash for getting hashes from any attribute pair.

## Viewpoint

* Added `Viewpoint.(expects,depends)` for declaring expectations and dependencies
* Added `Viewpoint.metadata` to query those expectations and dependencies
* Added `Viewpoint.build` to build viewpoints (with particular contexts)
* Removed `Viewpoint.namespace`, use `Viewpoint.depends` instead.

## Algebra

* Added `page` operator (page-index, page-size) implemented through `sort+take`
  where `take` is a new engine cog.
* Added `frame` operator (offset, limit Ã la SQL) implemented through `sort+take`
  as well.

## Engine & compilation

* All engine-compiled cogs may optionally be tagged with the expression they
  come from (as taken as last argument of initialize, and readable through
  `expr`).
* The default compiler uses this feature so that algebra expressions can be
  tracked back from compilation results.

## Adapter

* Adapter::Connection#cog now takes an optional `expr` parameter for
  traceability with algebra expressions. The resulting cog is expected to be
  tagged accordingly.

## I/O

* Added a `Ruby` input reader mapping to '.rb' and '.ruby' files.
* Reader no longer includes `Engine::Cog`. `Adapter::Folder::Connection`
  correctly adapts its `cog` method to return an Engine::Leaf instance that
  delegated to the reader itself.

## Database

* The `default_viewpoint` option has been renamed `viewpoint`

# 0.13.1 / 2013-08-05

* Empty lines are silently ignored by .rash reader
* Added Viewpoint#members

# 0.13.0 / 2013-07-29

The 0.13.0 version is a new birthday for alf. See `alf` main for CHANGELOG
history.
